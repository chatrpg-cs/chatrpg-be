      Eldrida is a massive continent with vast stretches of open plains,
      sprawling forests and treacherous mountain ranges.The land is divided into
      kingdoms and territories, some ruled by powerful monarchs, while others by
      wealthy merchants,cunning warlords or fearsome beasts. Alongside the sentient
      beings such as humans, dwarves, elves and halflings,there exist an array of
      monsters too - gnolls, ogres, trolls - who are constantly at odds and threaten
      to disrupt the country's peace.

      The city of Ironhaven is situated on the coast of Eldrida, where
      the clouds bring a salty tang and hardy ships dock regularly from elven ports
      in the east or human settlements in the west. As you arrive, it is apparent
      that this bustling town thrives on its mechanical wonders, such as the towering
      automatons that tower over every street corner, as well as mechanical transports
      running all around.

      As you stroll through the city streets, taking in the
      sounds and sights of clanking gears and belching steam stacks, something strange
      catches your attention. You hear noises coming from an alleyway - animals
      screeching, objects being thrown around and a strange rumbling sound. At first,
      you think it might be some simple scuffle or merchants having a heated argument.
      But, as you move closer and peek down the narrow lane â€“ all thoughts of simple
      misunderstandings vanish.

      What initially seems to be a brawl turns out
      to be a group of heavily-armored golems cornering a terrified half-elf merchant.
      You hear him cry out for help but there isn't anyone else-it's just you facing
      down these dangerous automata. They are unyielding machines with huge pistons
      carrying heavy metal fists that crack into walls whenever they quake forward.
      From their imposing heights, they snarl at his pleas to release him and step
      closer menacingly with every second.

      The half-elf's face is a mask of terror
      when he finally spots you behind them. His eyes widen with both hope and fear
      as he sees that you can help him out. "Please! Someone get me out of here
      before I become scrap metal," he cries desperately.
