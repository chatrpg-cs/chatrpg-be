    wealthy merchants,cunning warlords or fearsome beasts. Alongside the sentient
    beings such as humans, dwarves, elves and halflings,there exist an array of
    monsters too - gnolls, ogres, trolls - who are constantly at odds and threaten

    The city of Ironhaven is situated on the coast of Eldrida, where
    the clouds bring a salty tang and hardy ships dock regularly from elven ports
    in the east or human settlements in the west. As you arrive, it is apparent
    that this bustling town thrives on its mechanical wonders, such as the towering
    automatons that tower over every street corner, as well as mechanical transports
    running all around.

    As you stroll through the city streets, taking in the
    sounds and sights of clanking gears and belching steam stacks, something strange
    catches your attention. You hear noises coming from an alleyway - animals
    screeching, objects being thrown around and a strange rumbling sound. At first,
    you think it might be some simple scuffle or merchants having a heated argument.
    But, as you move closer and peek down the narrow lane â€“ all thoughts of simple
    misunderstandings vanish.

    What initially seems to be a brawl turns out
    to be a group of heavily-armored golems cornering a terrified half-elf merchant.
    You hear him cry out for help but there isn't anyone else-it's just you facing
    down these dangerous automata. They are unyielding machines with huge pistons
    carrying heavy metal fists that crack into walls whenever they quake forward.
    From their imposing heights, they snarl at his pleas to release him and step
    closer menacingly with every second.

    The half-elf's face is a mask of terror
    when he finally spots you behind them. His eyes widen with both hope and fear
    as he sees that you can help him out. "Please! Someone get me out of here
    before I become scrap metal," he cries desperately.
