    As you enter the city gates of Valoria, you are greeted by the sounds
    and smells of a bustling port town. The salty tang of the sea mixes with the aroma
    of freshly baked bread and roasting meat. You find yourself in the middle of a crowded
    market square, with merchants shouting out the prices of their wares and haggling
    with customers.


    To your left, you see a group of sailors unloading crates from
    a ship, while to your right, a group of street performers are putting on a show
    for a gathered crowd. You can hear the tinkle of coins as they are tossed into the
    performers' hats.


    As you make your way through the market, you catch snippets
    of conversation in various languages. You see humans of all shapes and sizes, as
    well as the occasional elf or dwarf. The people of Valoria are a diverse and colorful
    bunch.


    As you walk further into the city, you notice that the streets become
    narrower and more winding. The buildings around you are made of stone and are several
    stories tall, with wooden shutters on the windows. The air is cooler here, and you
    can feel a slight breeze rustling through the streets.


    In the distance, you
    hear the sound of a bell tolling. It is coming from a nearby cathedral, its spires
    rising high above the rooftops.
