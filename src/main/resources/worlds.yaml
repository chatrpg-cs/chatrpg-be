    initial-prompt: >
      The city of Ironhaven is situated on the coast of Eldrida, where the clouds bring a salty tang and hardy ships dock regularly from elven ports in the east or human settlements in the west. As you arrive, it is apparent that this bustling town thrives on its mechanical wonders, such as the towering automatons that tower over every street corner, as well as mechanical transports running all around.
      As you stroll through the city streets, taking in the sounds and sights of clanking gears and belching steam stacks, something strange catches your attention. You hear noises coming from an alleyway - animals screeching, objects being thrown around and a strange rumbling sound. At first, you think it might be some simple scuffle or merchants having a heated argument. But, as you move closer and peek down the narrow lane â€“ all thoughts of simple misunderstandings vanish.
      What initially seems to be a brawl turns out to be a group of heavily-armored golems cornering a terrified half-elf merchant. You hear him cry out for help but there isn't anyone else-it's just you facing down these dangerous automata. They are unyielding machines with huge pistons carrying heavy metal fists that crack into walls whenever they quake forward. From their imposing heights, they snarl at his pleas to release him and step closer menacingly with every second.
      The half-elf's face is a mask of terror when he finally spots you behind them. His eyes widen with both hope and fear as he sees that you can help him out. "Please! Someone get me out of here before I become scrap metal," he cries desperately.
